# ncode-net
Network-related features of ncode

This is a collection of graph algorithms and common grph functionality. It is intended to be used in small physical network-like graphs (hundreds to thousands of nodes). It includes:
- An efficient graph representation that allows for O(1) map/set operations on the graph
- Network topology generators, and a couple of real-life ISP networks
- Basic depth-limited DFS
- Single source shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm)
- All pairs shortest paths (Floydâ€“Warshall's algorithm)
- K simple shortest paths (Yen's algorithm)
- The ability to get the K shortest paths based on an imprecise path definition
